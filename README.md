# image_downsample

The idea of this short little week-in-between-classes project is that different resolutions of the same image are analagous to varying qualities of audio files, sort of. And if you share an "image" (but the image is really X number of encrypted images at varying resoltions), but only share the decrypton key to the lower resolution image, you've..... doing something different?

I think there could be a crypto use-case, where every subsequent transfer of an image releases a key that can be used to get a higher quality image of an NFT (and then maybe this the real advent of intrisinc value for NFTs, if you can say "i am the only person with this highest quality version of this image, because no one else has this encyrption key", you would actually have something that others don't)

Anyway, its just fun to mess around in python with images.
